SO ALL MY PODS/DEPLOYMENTS/SERVICES WERE CREATED PERFECTLY.

MY TOMCAT WEB APP HAS 2 INIT CONTAINERS WHICH WAS FAILING BECAUSE THE COMMAND {NSLOOKUP VPROB} WAS FAILING. 

THE VPRODB SERVICE IS RUNNING CORRECTLY POINTING TO THE RIGHT POD AND ALL THAT. 

SO I CREATED A TEST POD THAT RAN BUSY BOX IMAGE AND I TRIED NSLOOKUP TO VPRODB WITH ITS FQDN VPRODB.default.svc.cluster.local
SVC.NAMESPACE.SVC.CLUSTER.LOCAL

THE SERVICE WAS ONLY REACHABLE BY ITS FQDN, SO I MODIFIED THE INIT CONTAINER TO NSLOOKUP VPRODB.DEFAULT.SVC.CLUSTER.LOCAL AND THE ISSUE GOT FIXED
